/// The various options for how to output records to the standard output.

/// - none: No output; disables records displaying in the output.
/// - simple: Only outputs one item per event, no matter how many providers were recorded.
/// - verbose: Outputs one line for each provider per event, specifying which provider was recorded.
///   This is the best option if you are using many providers and want to verify data is being output
///   to each one.
