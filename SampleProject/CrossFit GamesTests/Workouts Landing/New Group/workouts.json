Upon completion of 55 reps of each exercise, time should be marked. When you submit your final result, your score will be the number of reps completed. There will be another field in which you will enter the elapsed time at which you completed your last full set on any of the exercises. In the case where two athletes have the same score (total number of reps), the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. If you are using a countdown timer, you must convert to elapsed time before reporting your score. For this reason, it is recommended you set your clock to count up.  </p>\n ",

At the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete will have 8 minutes to perform 3 rounds of 6 chest-to-bar pull-ups and 6 squat snatches, AND 3 rounds of 7 chest-to-bar pull-ups and 5 squat snatches. If all 72 repetitions are not completed within 8 minutes, the athlete’s workout is over, and they will stop and record their score.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If all 72 repetitions are completed within the 8-minute window, the athlete will earn an additional 4 minutes to continue with the couplet. If all 108 reps (36 from rounds 1-3, 36 from rounds 4-6 and 36 from rounds 7-9) are completed by the 12-minute mark, the time will once again be extended by 4 minutes. Throughout the workout, after every 3 complete rounds, the reps of the pull-up will increase, the reps of the snatch will decrease, and the barbell will get heavier. <strong>Once a 3-round section is completed, the athlete may immediately begin their next section. They do not need to wait for the 4-minute window to expire before moving on to the next section.</strong> This pattern will continue for up to 24 minutes, as long as 3 rounds of the couplet are completed before each cutoff.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This workout is over when the athlete completes all the required work prior to 24 minutes or fails to complete all the repetitions within the cutoff time for a section. The athlete’s score is their time if they complete the workout or the number of repetitions completed up to their cutoff time.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this workout, another person may assist the athlete in changing the plates on the barbell during the workout, or multiple barbells may be used.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">TIEBREAK</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If all 216 reps are completed prior to the 24-minute time cap, your score will be your total time and there will be no tiebreaker. However, if you are not able to complete the entire workout in the allotted time, a tiebreaker will be factored into your final score. During the workout, be sure to note your time at the end of each 3-round section. When you submit your score, there will be a space for your final rep count and an additional field for you to enter the elapsed time at which you completed your last full 3-round section. In the case where two athletes have the same score (total number of reps), the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. If you are using a countdown timer, you must convert to elapsed time before reporting your score. For this reason, it is recommended you set your clock to count up.</p>\n ",

This workout begins with the dumbbell resting on the floor and the athlete standing tall. At the call of “3, 2, 1… go!” the athlete will reach down and begin the dumbbell snatches, alternating arms after each repetition. Once all reps are complete, they will move to the box and perform 15 burpee box jump-overs, then move back to the snatch, etc. In each round the number of repetitions of the snatch will increase. This workout ends when the feet land on the ground on the other side of the box on the final rep.</p>\n\n<p>Every second counts in this workout. The athlete’s score will be the time it takes to complete all 225 repetitions. Time will be recorded in full seconds. Do not round up. If the athlete finishes in 10:32.7, their score is 10:32. There is a 20-minute time cap. If they do not finish all 225 reps before the time cap, their score will be the number of reps completed.</p>\n\n<h2>TIEBREAK</h2>\n\n<p>If all 225 reps are completed before the time cap, there is no tiebreaker for this workout. If all 225 reps are NOT completed within the 20-minute time cap, your score will be the total number of reps completed, with ties being broken by the time of completion of your last full set of burpee box jump-overs. At the end of each set of burpee box jump-overs, time should be marked and recorded for score submission. In the case where two athletes have completed the same number of reps, the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.</p>\n\n<p>Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. If you are using a countdown timer, you must convert to elapsed time before reporting your score. For this reason, it is recommended you set your clock to count up.</p>\n ",

At the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete will have 4 minutes to perform 25 toes-to-bars, followed by 50 double-unders, and then 15 squat cleans. If all 90 repetitions are not completed by 4 minutes the athlete’s workout is over, and they will stop and record their score.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If all 90 repetitions are completed within the 4-minute window the athlete will earn an additional 4 minutes to perform another 25 toes-to-bars, 50 double-unders, and 13 squat cleans, this time at a heavier weight. If all 178 repetitions (90 from round 1, plus 88 from round 2) are completed by the 8-minute mark, the athlete will begin another round and their time cap will be extended by an additional 4 minutes. At each round, the weight of the clean will increase while the number of reps of the clean will decrease. <strong>Once a round is completed, the athlete may immediately begin their next round. They do not need to wait for the 4-minute round to end before moving on to the next round.</strong> This pattern of earning additional time will continue for up to 20 minutes, as long as a full round is completed before the next cutoff.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This workout is over when the athlete fails to complete all the repetitions within the cut-off time for that round. The final round ends at the 20-minute mark. The athlete’s score is the number of repetitions completed up to their cut-off time.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this workout, another person may assist the athlete in changing the plates on the barbell during the workout, or multiple barbells may be used.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tiebreak</strong><br />\nThe scoring for this workout includes a tiebreak. At the end of each set of double-unders, time should be marked. When you submit your final result, your score will be the number of reps completed. There will be another field in which you will enter the elapsed time at which you completed your last set of double-unders. In the case where 2 athletes have the same score (total number of reps), the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.</p>\n\n<p>If all 5 rounds are completed in under 20 minutes, enter the time at which the last rep of the cleans was completed, as this will be used for the tiebreak score, not the time of completing the double-unders.</p>\n\n<p>Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. If you are using a countdown timer, you must convert to elapsed time before reporting your score. For this reason, it is recommended you set your clock to count up. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br />\n• Pull-up bar<br />\n• Jump rope<br />\n• Barbell<br />\n• Collars<br />\n• Plates to load to the appropriate weights for your division</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For each workout, be sure the athlete has adequate space to safely complete the workout. Clear the area of all extra equipment, people or other obstructions.</p>\n\n<p>*The official weight is in pounds. For your convenience, the minimum acceptable weights in kilograms are 20 kg (45 lb.), 25 kg (55 lb.), 29 kg (65 lb.), 34 kg (75 lb.), 38 kg (85 lb.), 43 kg (95 lb.), 47 kg (105 lb.), 52 kg (115 lb.), 56 kg (125 lb.), 61 kg (135 lb.), 65 kg (145 lb.), 70 kg (155 lb.), 79 kg (175 lb.), 83 kg (185 lb.), 93 kg (205 lb.), 102 kg (225 lb.), 106 kg (235 lb.), 124 kg (275 lb.), 142 kg (315 lb.).</p>\n ",

Additionally, intermediate marks must be made at every 5-foot interval, each of which represents 1 rep of the lunge.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This workout begins with the barbell resting on the floor near the pull-up bar. At the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete will pick up the barbell and lunge with it overhead for 25 feet. They will then perform 8 burpees, jumping over the barbell on each repetition, before picking the barbell back up and lunging back in the opposite direction. Once back at the pull-up bar, they will perform 8 chest-to-bar pull-ups, and then will head back to the barbell to begin the next round.</p>\n\n<p>Your score will be the total number of repetitions completed before the 20-minute time cap.</p>\n\n<p>If a straight 25-ft. lunge area cannot be setup, athletes will be permitted to lunge back and forth in a smaller area, so long as the 5-foot (1 rep) intermediate sections can created. For example, lunge 15 ft. one direction, then back 10 ft. the other direction. The bar may be held up at the turnaround, or dropped and picked up again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br />\n• Barbell<br />\n• Collars<br />\n• Plates to load to the appropriate weight for your division<br />\n• Pull-up bar<br />\n• Measuring tape</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For each workout, be sure the athlete has adequate space to safely complete the workout. Clear the area of all extra equipment, people or other obstructions.</p>\n*The official weight is in pounds. For your convenience, the minimum acceptable weights in kilograms are 43 kg (95 lb.), 29 kg (65 lb.), 20 kg (45 lb.), and 15 kg (35 lb.). For the lunge, a 7.5-meter length divided into five 1.5-meter sections will be acceptable.</div>\n\n<p> </p>\n ",
